    "Major Challenges faced during construction of program code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first major barrier faced during this project was be able to import the necessary Python libraries and how to include my own personal book selection into the initial list of books. The solution essentially boiled down to adjusting the import line to the version of python being used and understanding where to position the append() function in a loop. Much of the code written was first implemented and tested on Google collab before switching over to a Jupyter notebook on VS code, and variations within the python versions didn't allow for the import of the libraries without adjusting the line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second, and most significant challenge, faced was during the writing and trial phase of the menu program. Because of the large volume of different functions and variables involved, it was difficult to come up with a draft code that would be able to execute each and every action. The solution is one that I discovered remembered for a different project, which is to divide each aspect of the program on seperate cells, figure out the syntax and composition of each aspect individually, and combine all the codes into one unified cell (with adjustments).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third major noteworthy challenge was writing the code that would identify the part of the text containing the \"author\" section of the reading list, creating a sub-condition to check whether the author name was already included and then also finding a way to include a book counter in conjunction with the author name function. The solution (similar to 1) was to individually test each funtion and create the equality operator after the lists have been appended in the correct sequence. This also required intense research, as well as trial and error, to test the order of the syntax."
